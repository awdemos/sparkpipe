"""Enforce a monotonic ceiling for authored non-test source code.

Generated build products, test fixtures, documentation, caches, and package
receipts are not implementation source and must never move this number. The
previous counter included generated model-driver C files under build/, so its
ceiling changed depending on which tests had already run. This counter is
stable before and after a clean build.
