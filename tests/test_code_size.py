"""Enforce a monotonic ceiling for authored non-test source code.

Generated build products, test fixtures, documentation, caches, and package
receipts are not implementation source and must never move this number. The
previous counter included generated model-driver C files under build/, so its
ceiling changed depending on which tests had already run. This counter is
stable before and after a clean build.

# Phase 6 adds lossless per-lane completion ownership at the rank boundary,
# completion-to-transaction correlation, synchronous-callback deferral, strict
# final-event identity propagation, and rollback-safe submission ownership. The
# exact authored-source count at landing is retained so later changes remain
# monotonic. The follow-up audit landing adds tools/verify_package_manifest.py
# and wires more gates into tools/gates.sh; the ceiling moves by those
# tooling lines (86), no production source grew for its own sake.
# The audit-fix landing adds the mbarrier phase-parity model coverage
# (test_mma_fragment_mapping.c, +89), the deterministic-failure paths and their
# tests (node/backend.c +128, test_ring_service_backend_transactions.c +168),
# the shared smem opt-in (runtime/launch.h, qwen/kimi call sites net negative),
# and the new no-python/manifest gates; ceiling moves to the exact count.
# The performance wave adds the tensor-map descriptor cache
# (runtime/gemm_descriptor_cache.h + test), the comms arena (runtime/arena.h +
# test), the RDMA eviction/batching/lane-rotation logic in rdma.cu, the BF16
# collective path, and docs/PERF_ROADMAP_2026-08-01.md; ceiling moves to the
# exact count again.
